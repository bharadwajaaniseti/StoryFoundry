I've identified the issue with the project creation authentication. The problem is that API routes in Next.js 15 require a specific cookie handling pattern for Supabase SSR to work correctly.

## Problem Summary

The authentication was failing in the API route `/api/projects/create` with "Auth session missing!" error, even though users were properly authenticated in the frontend.

## Root Cause

The issue was in how cookies were being handled between the frontend authentication and the API route. Supabase SSR requires specific cookie management patterns that differ between:
1. Client components (working)
2. Server components (working) 
3. API routes (was failing)

## Solution Implemented

I've updated the API route with the correct Supabase SSR pattern:

### Key Changes Made:

1. **Proper Cookie Handling**: Updated the cookie management in the API route to follow the exact Supabase SSR pattern
2. **Response Management**: Fixed how responses are created and cookies are set
3. **Enhanced Logging**: Added detailed logging to help debug authentication issues
4. **Error Handling**: Improved error responses with proper cookie headers

### Files Updated:

- `src/app/api/projects/create/route.ts` - Fixed authentication and cookie handling
- `src/app/app/projects/new/page.tsx` - Added enhanced logging for debugging

## Testing Instructions

1. Sign in to the application at `/signin`
2. Navigate to `/app/projects/new`  
3. Fill out the project creation form
4. Submit the form

The project creation should now work correctly with proper authentication.

## Technical Details

The API route now:
- Creates a proper Supabase client with correct cookie handlers
- Manages response cookies correctly
- Provides detailed authentication logging
- Returns proper error responses with authentication context

This follows the official Supabase SSR documentation for Next.js 15 App Router.
