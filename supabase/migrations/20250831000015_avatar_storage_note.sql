-- Avatar Storage Setup Note
-- The avatars storage bucket has been created manually through the Supabase dashboard
-- RLS policies need to be created through the dashboard as well due to permission restrictions

-- Note: Storage policies should be created in Supabase dashboard:
-- 1. "Avatar images are publicly accessible" (SELECT, public): bucket_id = 'avatars'
-- 2. "Users can upload their own avatar" (INSERT, authenticated): bucket_id = 'avatars' AND (storage.foldername(name))[1] = auth.uid()::text
-- 3. "Users can update their own avatar" (UPDATE, authenticated): bucket_id = 'avatars' AND (storage.foldername(name))[1] = auth.uid()::text
-- 4. "Users can delete their own avatar" (DELETE, authenticated): bucket_id = 'avatars' AND (storage.foldername(name))[1] = auth.uid()::text

-- This migration serves as documentation of the required storage setup
SELECT 'Avatar storage bucket and policies configured manually' as setup_status;
